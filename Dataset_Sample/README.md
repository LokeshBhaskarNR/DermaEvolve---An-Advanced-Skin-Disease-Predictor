### **Sample Dermatological Disease Dataset**

This is a **sample dataset** derived from a larger dermatological dataset aimed at skin disease classification. The sample dataset contains images from multiple skin disease categories, with **500 images per class**. It provides a balanced representation of the different skin conditions for use in training, research, and educational purposes.

The Complete Dataset is derived from multiple existing datasets : 
- **HAM10000**: Human Against Machine (HAM) 10000 dataset
- **ISIC**: International Skin Imaging Collaboration
- **DermNetNZ**: DermNet New Zealand

#### **Dataset Overview**
The dataset is organized into the following classes:
- **Actinic Keratosis**
- **Basal Cell Carcinoma**
- **Blue Naevus**
- **Dermatofibroma**
- **Elastosis Perforans Serpiginosa**
- **Lentigo Maligna**
- **Melanocytic Nevus**
- **Melanoma**
- **Nevus Sebaceus**
- **Pigmented Benign Keratosis**
- **Seborrheic Keratosis**
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
- **Vascular Lesion**

Each class contains **500 images**, carefully sampled from the full dataset of 126,308 images. These images have been processed and labeled for training skin disease classification models using deep learning techniques.

#### **Purpose of the Dataset**
The sample dataset is designed for:
- **Model prototyping**: Quickly train and test skin disease classification models.
- **Research**: Aid in dermatological disease research by providing a starting point for experiments.
- **Educational use**: Serve as a resource for machine learning and computer vision projects.

#### **Dataset Access**

This dataset is made available for educational, research, and prototyping purposes. If you wish to access the full dataset containing all the images (126,308), please contact us directly.
